End-users:

The only file you are probably interested in is [regenv.exe](https://github.com/lunakid/regenv-win32/raw/master/test/vc/regenv.exe),
you can just grab it and run! ;-o

The rest of this text is for developers. See [README.txt](README.txt) for end-user docs.


Developers:

* The stuff currently compiles with Visual Studio C++ 2010 and MinGW/GCC 4.7.

* See [CHANGES.txt](CHANGES.txt) for pending/finished issues.

* The stuff under .prj is a crude Windows project scaffolding kit I use locally.
  The `prj.cmd`, `shell.cmd` and `save.cmd` convenience shortcuts are also part of it.
  You can safely ignore it.
