	RegEnv LICENSE
	--------------

	RegEnv (then called "WinEnv") was originally an update of the 
	SetEnv tool released by	Jonathan Wilkes. SetEnv version 1.08 
	was used as the starting point of this work. His sources have 
	"Copyright (C) 2005-2008 Jonathan Wilkes - All Rights Reserved", 
	according to the details in SetEnv-1.08-LICENSE.txt.
	
	Eventually, however, practically all of the original concept and 
	code got replaced by my own work, which effectively required a new 
	licensing baseline. I chose a similar license to Jonathan's, so
	keeping him duly credited for the initial code-base, this current
	work is released as:

	Copyright (C) 2012-2014 Szabolcs Szasz - Some rights reserved,
	Copyright (C) 2005-2008 Jonathan Wilkes - All Rights Reserved,

	according to
